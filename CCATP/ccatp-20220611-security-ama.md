Question I could pose to the community:

In a future episode of Chit Chat Across the Pond (hopefully 11 June 2022), security enthusiast Bart Busschots would like to open up the floor to answer your security questions. Think of it as an Ask Me Anything ... about security.

This is your chance to ask the "Dumb Questions" that have been bothering you for a long time. These are the questions you think everyone else knows the answers to, but I guarantee you we don't.  While Bart and I tend to talk primarily about Apple products, your security questions can be much broader than that. 

Maybe you have a question about opening ports on your router to access your PLEX library outside of your home network. Maybe you want to know how often to apply patches to your Windows computer and how to tell when it's no longer getting patches. Maybe you want advice on how to talk to your brother who you know is not as secure as he could be but he hasn't listened to your advice in the past. Maybe you want to know why a dedicated password manager is any better than using the password management built into modern browsers like Microsoft Edge and Firefox. Maybe you've been hearing a security acronym or jargon and you don't know what it means.

If you'd like to be referenced by name, please tell us how you'd like to be addressed. For example, "Steven from Canada asks…" If you don't tell us how you'd like to be addressed, we'll assume you would prefer to be anonymous.

The sooner your question gets to us, the more likely it is to be answered because Bart will have more time to formulate his answer.  If we get enough questions, we'll be recording the answers on the show scheduled for 11 June 2022. If we get too many questions to answer in one session, we'll do another show at a later date.

Please send your questions to allison@podfeet.com and I'll share them with Bart. We're looking forward to hearing your questions.

Places/people we can ask:

* On the NosillaCast
* Twitter Al & Bart - this will have to be a screenshot. For accessibility, simply copy the text and paste it into the image description before posting.
* Facebook - I'll ask Steve to post it
* Slack - I'll tag @everyone (I don't like to do that often but this is a perfect use of it)
* I never ask the Patrons anything, if I can figure out how to do it, I will
* Lynda Gousha - she uses Security Bits for her user group, so we can have her post it to her community
* SBAMUG - local user group I talk to
* LAPUG - local user group with an overall higher tech understanding


# Questions:

BJ from Pennsylvania asks: 

>Why is multi factor authentication more secure than just using a password? Or, in other words, why would someone want to use multi factor authentication protocols to Lee themselves more secure?

Mr. Ed from the chatroom, also known as Ed Tobias asks: 

> I use Synology Quick Connect via the DS File app on my iPhone. I can see all the files on my NAS from anywhere. How does this work when I don’t have any port forwarding for this on my router and is it safe?"

James Carroll from THORLaser.com asks:

>Can I share usernames and passwords with my wife or work colleague safely via Apple Messages (previously iMessage) with no risk of interception (unless the baddies somehow get their hands on our unlocked Apple devices or iCloud account)"

> Assume we all have Apple devices logged into iCloud (not messaging via SMS)

> Also, on that basis, are Apple Messages any more or less secure than What’s App, Telegram, Signal or Teams for messaging?

> I have no urge to hide my location or anything else but I draw the line at giving away usernames and passwords

Lynda from Silicon Valley is concerned about doxxing - where trolls publish private information about you because of something you said online, say on Twitter. She asks:

> Are there any ‘anti doxxing’ tutorials or advice you can give to protect oneselve, other than just keeping one’s mouth shut?

Allison Sheridan from Los Angeles asks in regards to FIDO and the new Passkey method of passwordless login:

>If I have an existing password-based account on a website, and I switch to a passkey, will the website remember the old password? Because if so, it would then still be possible for a bad actor to log in using that old password. In the same vein, what happens if you click on "I forgot my password"? Will every website have to know you've switched to passkeys and know to securely erase just _your_ password?
