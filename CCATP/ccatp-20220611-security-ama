Question I could pose to the community:

In a future episode of Chit Chat Across the Pond, security enthusiast Bart Busschots would like to open up the floor to answer your security questions. Think of it as an Ask Me Anything ... about security.

This is your chance to ask the "Dumb Questions" that have been bothering you for a long time. These are the questions you think everyone else knows the answers to, but I guarantee you we don't.  While Bart and I tend to talk primarily about Apple products, your security questions can be much broader than that. 

Maybe you have a question about opening ports on your router to access your PLEX library outside of your home network. Maybe you want to know how often to apply patches to your Windows computer and how to tell when it's no longer getting patches. Maybe you want advice on how to talk to your brother who you know is not as secure as he could be but he hasn't listned to your advice in the past. Maybe you want to know why a dedicated password manager is any better than using the password management built into modern browsers like Microsoft Edge and Firefox.

If you'd like to be referenced by name, please tell us how you'd like to be addressed. For example, "Steven from Canada asksâ€¦" If you don't tell us how you'd like to be addressed, we'll assume you would prefer to be anonymous.

The sooner your question gets to us, the more likely it is to be answered because Bart will have more time to formulate his answer.  If we get enough questions, we'll be recording the answers on the show scheduled for 11 June 2022.

Please send your questions to allison@podfeet.com and I'll share them with Bart. We're looking forward to hearing your questions.
