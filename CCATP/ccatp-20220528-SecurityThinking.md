# CCATP 28 May 2022 â€” Thinking About Security

As a general rule, the more specific security advice is, the less useful it is, because it will have a short shelf-life and apply only to specific scenarios. The most honest answer to a general security question usually stars with *'it depends â€¦'* ðŸ™‚

So, rather than list out some soon-to-be-stale advice that probably doesn't apply to your precise situation, I thought it might be fun to share some of the ways I think about security. The digital world changes fast, so you're always having to think about new things and re-think things you thought you were done thinking about. There are a million right ways to go make these kinds of judgements, but here are some of the things I keep in mind when I'm doing it.

## Take Action!

If you're not doing anything about security, you're probably doing it wrong!

### Don't Forget the Risk of NOT Acting!

Just about everything you choose to do has some risk. Something can always go wrong when you make a change, so, it's easy to fall into the habit of doing nothing, especially in a corporate environment. Is it really worth your time trying to convince a manager that the risk is worth taking?

Whether you're justifying a risk to yourself, your manager, or a change-control-board, don't fall into the trap of ignoring the risk of **not** acting. Sure, all actions have some risk, but when it comes to security, there's usually a **huge** risk in doing nothing! If you remember to include that in your deliberations or your proposals, you'll find it a lot easier to get things done!

### Remember that Risks Grow!

In my mind I think of the phrase *"attacks always get better"* as *Schneier's Law*, because it was security guru Bruce Schneier who popularised the term for me, but it turns out Bruce already had a law from earlier in his career, so I've had to start thinking of it as *Schneier's Second Law*!

In case you're wondering, the first law is the perfect argument against inventing your own security:

> "Any person can invent a security system so clever that she or he can't think of how to break it."

But back to what I'm calling Schneier's second law:

> "Attacks always get better"

When a vulnerability is found, there will probably be a proof of concept, and that will make it appear like the bug can only do a finite amount of harm, that initial impression is an illusion, it's the the most damage someone has figured out how to do **now**, clever people will find better ways to use the vulnerability more effectively, so things are generally already, or soon to be, worse than they seem.

So, always over-defend, and if the decision is border-line, err on the side of doing, because the chances are high that the problem is about to get worse than you think!

### The Inverted Pyramid of Pain

Where to start is a big question â€” so big most people and organisations become paralysed by it, and simply fall back into a perpetual reactive mode. If you're lucky, you're reacting to warnings from security agencies and reports from auditors, but sooner or later you'll be reacting to attacks.

Some pro-active security hardening is easy and involves little to no pain, and some is effectively impossible. You might think the easy stuff is likely to have small rewards, so is probably not worth it, but you'd be utterly wrong â€” the easy things tend to have the biggest effect, and the hardest things, the smallest effect! You can diagram that as an upside-down triangle, with ease (lack of pain) on the vertical axis and reward mirrored around the origin on the on the horizontal axis. This makes for a fun slide in presentations, and is generally referred to as *'the inverted pain triangle'*.

The bottom line is wonderful â€” **do the easy stuff first** because it will give you the best results for your efforts!

## Make Choices

So you're all inspired to go do something, great, but now you're going to be faced with decisions â€” what's the right value for this setting? What permissions should I give this user/computer/network? You'll inevitably be making tradeoffs, and each situation is different, but some general guiding principles can help a lot.

### The Principle of Least Privileges

### Think Defensively

## Spread the Word!

### Don't Moralise, Evangelise!

### 'See something, say something!'
