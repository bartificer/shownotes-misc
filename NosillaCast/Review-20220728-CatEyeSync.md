# CatEye Sync Bike Lights (Bart Busschots)

When it comes to cycling safely, I don't think it's possible to underestimate the importance of lights. I think everyone know how important it is to see where you're going if you're riding on dark roads, but what a lot of people overlook is the importance of *being seen* lights at all times on all roads. It's a well known fact that drivers often literally don't see cyclists because our human pattern matching algorithms are far from perfect, and cyclists can blend into the background and road-side clutter. Bright clothing helps, but really, if you like being seen and not killed, you need bright blinking lights day and night.

Because lights are so important, you need lights you can trust. For years I've used the same brand ‚Äî CatEye, all the bikes in our house have standard CatEye mounting brackets front and rear, as do all our cycling helmets. The decades old standard mounting system with it's myriad of options and adaptors are one of the things I love about CatEye. I have handlebar mounts, seat-post mounts, under-saddle mounts, rear-strut mounts, and helmet mounts, as well as clothing clips. One trend that the company has been developing over the last 5 or 10 years has not sat great with me ‚Äî they seem to be falling in love with removable adjustable rubber strap mounting options. I want to line things up perfectly and fix them in place, not have to adjust everything each time I put the light back on after charging! I do like their other trend though ‚Äî USB-charging rather than disposable batteries (though I wish it were not micro-USB!).

This all sounds fantastic, where's the problem to be solved?

## Pain-Points with Regular CatEye Lights

1. No battery indicator, just a low-battery warning which often gives just 45 minutes notice. Fine for short trips, but not my 2 hour daily cycle! (Why I carry a spare front and back light at all times)
2. No way to check the current state of a light you can't easily see, like one clipped to the back of your jersey, or helmet.
3. No way to easily control the mode of a light you can't easily reach

Basically, CatEye lights have not been smart devices, and they've not cooperated with each other as a team.

## Enter the new CatEye Sync System

Since the last time I bought new lights a year or two ago, CatEye have launched a whole new line of connected smart lights they've branded as their [CatEye Sync](https://www.cateye.com/cateyesync/) system.

The system has three broad parts ‚Äî a required smartphone app (available for Android & iOS), a single primary light that acts as a kind of hub, and additional lights that can be used independently as *dumb* (not smart) lights, or paired to a primary light.

At the moment there is only one primary light available, the [Sync Core](https://www.cateye.com/intl/products/headlights/HL-NW100RC/). It's a front light with three constant brightness modes (500, 150 lumens, & 100 lumens), a hybrid constant+flashing mode (100 + 500 lumens), and simple flashing mode. The light takes 3-4 hours to charge, and gives you a big range or usage times from 2 hours at full brightness to 130 hours flashing!

The charging is still Micro-USB üôÅ, but the mounting bracket is the same standard they've used for literally decades, so it clipped right onto my existing handlebar and helmet mounts üôÇ

You can use the light as as dumb light and it behaves like all CatEye headlights have for as long as I can remember. There is just one button, press it for 2 seconds to turn the light on or off, press it once to toggle to the next mode in a five-mode cycle, and double-click to jump to high mode, then single click to revert to the previous mode.

To turn the light into a smart light, pair it with the CatEye Sync app. The pairing process is wonderfully simple. Open the app, press the plus button to add a device, and follow the instructions ‚Äî basically, all CatEye Sync lights within range will flash, and you push the button on the one you want to pair, and your phone is now paired to that light.

Once you have a Sync Core paired, you can add additional Sync lights to your system. ATM there are three additional models available, all rear lights. There's the [Sync Kinetic](https://www.cateye.com/intl/products/safety_lights/TL-NW100K/) which is a large rear light, and a small clip-on light called the [Sync Wearable](https://www.cateye.com/intl/products/safety_lights/SL-NW100/).

I bought the [starter kit](https://www.cateye.com/intl/products/headlights/HL-NW100RC_TL-NW100K/) which includes a Sync Core and a Sync Kinetic, as well as one Sync Wearable. I bought from Amazon's UK store as a Prime customer, and my total bill came to ¬£92.23 (‚Ç¨110.92).

The Sync Kinetic is a full-size rear light with the usual array if flashing and solid modes, but it also has a party trick ‚Äî it has an accelerometer, and it can automatically flip in and out of full brightness mode when it detects braking, which is really cool! CatEye call this *Kinetic Mode*, hence the name of the light. It has flashing modes designed for day and night, so I've been using it in day-time mode with Kinetic Mode enabled. The charge time is about 2¬Ω hours, and the battery life varies between just 1¬Ω hours if you leave it set to constant at full brightness (40 lumens), to 30 hours in day-time mode with kinetic mode turned off. If you use day time mode (50 lumens flashing) with kinetic mode turned on, and you do trigger the accelerometer 60 times you should get 7 hours on a charge.

The real magic comes when you pair the Sync Kinetic with the app. Now, turning the Sync Core on or off controls **both** lights! The Sync core's single button has a red or green LED. If it's a sold green then at least one additional light is successfully connected, and all devices have more than 20% charge. If the light stays green but starts flashing then one of the connected lights is running low on power, and if it turns red and flashes then the Sync Core is low on power.

So far so good. But, it's not all roses. Not only does the Sync Kinetic not use the standard rear-light mounting bracket CatEye have used for years, they don't even provide an adaptor like they do for some of their other lights. This light can only be added using a bloody annoying rubber strap üôÅ

The Sync Wearable is similar to the Kinetic, even even has the same cool accelerometer feature. but it's physically smaller, circular, and designed to be clipped onto clothing rather than directly to the bike, though it does come with a rubber band for clipping it to the seat post. It charges as quickly as the Kinetic (2¬Ω hours), has the same modes with the same brightnesses, but has fewer actual LED bulbs, and a slightly shorter battery life of just 6 hours in day-time flashing mode with 60 braking events.

Again, like with the Kinetic, there is no adaptor to connect the Sync Wearable to the standard rear mount, and in my experience the clip for clipping it onto clothing is a pain in the backside to actually clip on and off. The thing is round and smooth and just wants to shoot out of your hand and hit you in the face!

All of my testing has been during the summer time, so I've been using my three lights in their day-time modes, and they work as advertised. Each day I press the button on the Sync Core for 2 seconds and all my lights come on. They all remember the last mode their were in, and they do their thing until I get home and power them all down in one go by pressing and holding the button in the Core.

I did end up cycling late enough on one evening that I used the flash+constant mode on the Core, and I was happy to find that changing the mode on the Core doesn't change the modes on the Kinetic or Wearable, it's just the power and power off commands that sync, which is good.

I can also verify that the status LED works as advertised, I intentionally let the batteries run low on the Kinect one day and the Wearable the next, and in both cases the constant green LED on the Core started to blink when the connected light got down to 20% battery remaining.

According to the docs you can have up to 7 connected lights, but I've only experimented with a set of 3 (since that's all I own).

## How's the App?

I've only tried the iOS version, and it works fine. It does what the blurb says it should, and it does it well. But, I can see a lot of room for future enhancements all the same.

Firstly, the pairing process is easy. Secondly, the app shows you the current status of all connected lights right on the home screen, including a big clear easy to read battery indicator for each. It also tells you the connection status, and if any one of the lights is not connected to the phone it shows the last date and time the phone saw the light, so you know how stale the battery status is.

The home page also gives you a big power button that's basically a software version of the single hardware button on the Sync Core, you press-and-hold for 2 seconds to power all the lights on or off. To my surprise, you don 't seem to be able to change the mode on each individual light from the app though. Or, if you can, the UI is not discoverable enough for me to find it. What you can do though is disable individual modes on each light, so if you only ever want to use 2 of the five modes, you can disable the three you don't want, and then the button on the light will only toggle between the two you left enabled. You can also enable or disable *Kinetic mode* (the accelerometer thing) from within each light's page in the app.

## Does it Solve the Pain Points?

Yes!

1. I can easily see all the battery statuses in the app, so I can re-charge well before the 20% warning the lights themselves give, and always be confident that I have at least 2 hours of light available to me.
2. Both the status light on the Sync Core and the home screen of the app let me quickly verify that the lights I can't see are connected and in sync as expected.
3. Both the Sync Core's physical button and the app's virtual button let me power on and off all my lights at once.

But, there is one down-side, neither of the available rear light options can be connected to the standard CatEye rear mount, not even with an adaptor, so you simply have to use the rubber strap for the Kinetic, and a rubber strap or cloths clip for the Wearable. If CatEye were to release adaptors for the two rear light options the system would be absolutely perfect for me. Still, on the whole I'm extremely happy with the upgrade.
